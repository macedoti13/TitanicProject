# Titanic competition from Kaggle

This is my approach to the titanic competition hosted by Kaggle. All the work in this repository was made by me. I'm also in an very early stage of my data science learning journy, so consider that this notebook has been made by a person without experience in the area. 

### What's the objective?

The point of the competition is the predict if a titanic passenger has survived the disaster or not, based on it's data. 

### What model did I build? 
 
I tested several different models, but in the end, I chosed the 'Support Vector Classifier' model, because it brought the best results. 

### How good was my model?

Not that much. I was able correctly predict the fate of 78% of the passengers. That's not a very high number, but it was enough to beat the standard Kaggle score, wich is around 76%.
